#Django User Templates App
 
User templates intends to help the final user providing a way to create many 
 templates.

It uses Django's native render to render a string and converts it to a PDF 
 file. The default, and simple, view uses [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) to
 write the template.

It can be used as:

* Contracts templates;
* Forms templates (CMS);
    
To be developed:

* Custom easy connection to other apps; 
* More files formats;
* An interface, a cool one! :D
* An easy way to the user select what is static and what will be a variable.
