#Django User Tempaltes App
 
User templates intends to help the user. It provides to the final user of the
 system a way to create many templates.

 default, and simple, view uses [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) to write the 
 template.

* Forms templates (CMS);
    
To be developed:

* Custom easy connection to other apps; 
* More files formats;
* An interface, a cool one! :D
* An easy way to the user select what is static and what will be a variable.
